        <h2 id="introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          GAIT (GraphQL API Interactive Tool) is designed to bridge the gap
          between users and complex GraphQL APIs by allowing interaction through
          natural language constructs. The tool leverages NLP, voice
          recognition, and real-time API introspection.
        </p>

        <p>
          GraphQL has become a widely adopted query language for APIs, offering
          flexibility and efficiency in data retrieval. However, interacting
          with GraphQL APIs requires technical knowledge of query structures,
          schema introspection, and API endpoints. This complexity presents a
          barrier for non-technical users and even slows down experienced
          developers when exploring new APIs. To address this challenge, GAIT
          (GraphQL API Interactive Tool) was developed as an intuitive web-based
          framework that allows users to interact with GraphQL APIs using
          natural language constructs. By leveraging Natural Language Processing
          (NLP), voice recognition, and real-time schema introspection, GAIT
          enables users to query GraphQL APIs without manually writing queries.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 id="related-work">2. Related Work</h2>
        <p>
          Natural language interfaces for databases have been widely studied,
          primarily in the context of SQL-based systems. Many solutions, such as
          ColloQL and Seq2SQL, focus on translating user queries into structured
          SQL commands. These tools use rule-based approaches or deep learning
          models to understand user intent and generate queries accordingly.
          However, these systems are fundamentally tied to relational databases,
          which have predefined schemas. In contrast, GraphQL APIs require
          dynamic schema introspection, as API structures may change frequently.
          GAIT overcomes this limitation by integrating real-time introspection,
          allowing it to dynamically generate queries based on the latest API
          schema.
        </p>

        <p>
          Conversational agents such as Google Dialogflow and IBM Watson
          Assistant have also explored natural language interaction with
          structured data. These tools allow developers to create predefined
          intents and responses for user queries, enabling some level of API
          interaction. However, they lack the flexibility to handle dynamic
          GraphQL schemas without extensive manual configuration. Unlike these
          systems, GAIT does not rely on predefined intents or static query
          mappings. Instead, it dynamically analyzes GraphQL schemas and
          generates valid queries in real-time, making it a more adaptable and
          scalable solution for API interaction.
        </p>

        <p>
          Several tools and platforms exist for interacting with GraphQL APIs,
          but they often require technical expertise. Notable related work
          includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>GraphiQL:</strong> A web-based interactive GraphQL IDE
            allowing developers to test and validate queries.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>ColloQL:</strong> A system enabling natural language-based
            SQL queries, which serves as inspiration for GAIT's query processing
            pipeline.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>SPARQL Query Builders:</strong> Various RDF-based query
            builders exist, but few integrate real-time NLP processing for
            dynamic query generation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Voice-Driven Assistants:</strong> Platforms such as Google
            Assistant and Alexa provide voice-enabled querying, but their
            integration with GraphQL is minimal.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="backend-query-services">4. Backend Query Services</h2>
        <p>
          The backend services of GAIT handle various aspects of GraphQL query
          processing, SPARQL data management, and multilingual support. It is
          designed to efficiently manage and process user queries, convert
          natural language into structured API requests, and store these
          interactions for future reference.
        </p>

        <h3>4.1 GraphQL Query Processing</h3>
        <p>
          GAIT enables users to interact with multiple GraphQL APIs by
          converting natural language queries into structured GraphQL requests.
          The backend follows these steps:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Query Interpretation:</strong> User input is processed using
            NLP models to extract key entities.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>API Mapping:</strong> The system identifies the relevant
            GraphQL API based on extracted entities.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Query Construction:</strong> Dynamic GraphQL queries are
            generated based on user intent.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Execution & Response:</strong> Queries are executed, and the
            JSON response is structured for readability.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This approach allows seamless interaction with multiple GraphQL APIs,
          providing users with accurate and real-time results.
        </p>

        <h3>4.2 SPARQL Query Storage</h3>

          GAIT incorporates an RDF-based query storage system using SPARQL,
          which allows structured representation of user queries. The benefits
          of this approach include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Permanent storage of user queries with metadata.</li>
          <li>Efficient retrieval of past queries using SPARQL queries.</li>
          <li>
            Integration with Linked Data applications for extended
            interoperability.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The system ensures that user interactions are logged in a format that
          supports efficient querying and analysis of API usage trends.
        </p>

        <p>
          GAIT provides multilingual query support, making it accessible to
          users in different linguistic regions. This feature is implemented
          through:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Language Detection:</strong> The backend automatically
            detects the language of the query using DeepL.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Translation:</strong> If the detected language is not
            English, the query is translated into English before processing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Response Handling:</strong> Query results are translated
            back into the user’s preferred language.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Currently, GAIT partially supports Romanian, German, and English, with
          future plans to extend support for additional languages.
        </p>

          GAIT’s backend is built on FastAPI, ensuring high-performance
          processing of API queries. Several optimizations have been
          implemented:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Asynchronous Processing:</strong> FastAPI’s async
            capabilities allow non-blocking query execution.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Caching:</strong> Frequently accessed API responses are
            cached to reduce redundant requests.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Load Balancing:</strong> Requests are distributed
            efficiently to ensure system stability under high loads.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Database Optimization:</strong> The RDF store is indexed to
            allow fast retrieval of stored queries.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These enhancements enable GAIT to handle a high volume of user
          interactions with minimal response time.

            </code></pre>

        <h3>Authentication and Private Routes</h3>
        <p>
          The <code>PrivateRoutes</code> component ensures that only
          authenticated users can access specific pages. It checks
          authentication status via the <code>useAuth</code> hook and redirects
          unauthorized users to the sign-in page.
        </p>

        <pre>
import { Outlet, Navigate } from &quot;react-router-dom&quot;;
          import { useAuth } from &quot;../hooks/context.js&quot;;
          
          const PrivateRoutes = () =&gt; {
            const { userData } = useAuth();
            return userData.email !== &quot;&quot; ? &lt;Outlet /&gt; : &lt;Navigate to=&quot;/sign-in&quot; /&gt;;
          };
          export default PrivateRoutes;</pre
        >

        <h3>Layout and User Interface</h3>
        <p>
          The <code>Layout</code> component defines the main structure of the
          application, including navigation menus that dynamically adjust based
          on user authentication status. This ensures a fluid user experience,
          whether the user is signed in or browsing anonymously.
        </p>

        <h3>User Context and Authentication</h3>
        <p>
          The <code>UserContextProvider</code> manages authentication state,
          login, and registration processes. It also utilizes
          <strong>localStorage</strong> to persist session data across page
          reloads.
        </p>

        <h3>Query Submission</h3>
        <p>
          The <code>QueryPage</code> component is the primary interface for
          users to interact with GraphQL APIs. It supports both text-based and
          voice-based query inputs, utilizing the
          <strong>webkitSpeechRecognition</strong> API for speech-to-text
          conversion. Upon submission, queries are processed and sent to the
          backend for execution.
        </p>

        <h3>Sign-In and Authentication Handling</h3>
        <p>
          The <code>SignInPage</code> handles user authentication by validating
          email and password credentials. It integrates form validation
          techniques and manages authentication status via the
          <code>useAuth</code> hook.
        </p>

        <h3>User Profile Management</h3>
        <p>
          The <code>UserProfile</code> component allows users to update their
          profile, manage their query history, and modify their settings. It
          provides functionality for changing passwords, uploading profile
          pictures, and managing saved queries.

          <h2>Sequence Diagram: Full Query Flow with Voice</h2>
          <p>
            The sequence diagram below outlines the end-to-end flow of a user
            query in the GAIT system, starting from user authentication to
            displaying results and optional bookmarking or downloading. The
            diagram highlights the interactions between the user, the React
            application, backend APIs, and external services like Google
            Speech-to-Text, Google Translate, and public GraphQL APIs.

          <h3>Diagram Description</h3>
          <p>
            The process begins with user authentication, where login credentials
            are verified against the User Profile Database. Once authenticated,
            the user submits a query via voice input, which is processed using
            the Google Speech-to-Text API to convert audio into text. If
            necessary, the text is then sent to the Google Translate API for
            language conversion. The translated or original query is forwarded
            to the Query Generator API, which constructs a valid GraphQL
            request. This request is passed to the Integrator API, which
            communicates with public GraphQL APIs to fetch the required data. If
            translation is required, the results are sent back to the Google
            Translate API before being stored in the Query History Database and
            displayed to the user. Finally, users have the option to bookmark or
            download results, with actions being managed by the Query Generator
            API and stored in the system database.

          <h3>Workflow Summary</h3>
          <p>
            The GAIT system follows a structured workflow that begins with user
            authentication. Once logged in, users submit queries either through
            voice or text input. The system processes the input, applying
            translation if needed, and generates a valid GraphQL query. This
            query is executed against external GraphQL APIs, retrieving relevant
            data. If required, results are translated back into the user’s
            preferred language before being displayed. Additionally, users have
            the option to bookmark or download their query results for future
            use, enhancing usability and accessibility.

        <p>
          GAIT has undergone extensive unit and integration testing using
          pytest. The results indicate high accuracy in query conversion and
          reliable API interactions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The backend has been tested rigorously using automated unit tests and
          integration tests.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Unit Testing:</strong> Pytest-based tests cover query
            conversion, API interactions, and RDF storage validation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Integration Testing:</strong> Simulated requests are run
            against public GraphQL APIs to verify response consistency.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Performance Testing:</strong> Query execution time is
            measured under different workloads to ensure scalability.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>SPARQL Query Validation:</strong> Tests ensure that stored
            RDF data is retrievable with accurate SPARQL queries.

        <h2 id="challenges-solutions">7. Challenges & Solutions</h2>
        <p>
          During the development of GAIT, several challenges were encountered,
          requiring innovative solutions to ensure smooth functionality and user
          experience.
        </p>

        <h3>Natural Language Understanding Accuracy</h3>
        <p>
          One of the primary difficulties was ensuring that the system correctly
          interprets natural language queries and maps them to valid GraphQL
          queries. Misinterpretation of user intent could lead to incorrect or
          failed API requests.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Solution:</strong> To address this, we integrated a
          <strong>Natural Language Understanding (NLU) module</strong> that
          leverages machine learning models trained on diverse datasets.
        </p>

        <h3>Voice Input Processing</h3>
        <p>
          Recognizing and converting voice queries into structured text while
          maintaining accuracy was a significant challenge, especially with
          variations in accents and speech patterns.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Solution:</strong> We utilized the
          <strong>Google Speech-to-Text API</strong>, which provides high
          accuracy in voice recognition.
        </p>

        <h3>GraphQL Query Generation</h3>
        <p>
          Dynamically constructing correct GraphQL queries based on user intent
          and available API schema required careful handling to avoid syntax
          errors and missing parameters.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Solution:</strong> The <strong>Query Generator</strong> was
          designed to use schema introspection, ensuring that only valid API
          queries are formed.
        </p>

        <h3>Efficient API Integration and Response Formatting</h3>
        <p>
          Different GraphQL APIs have varied response structures, making it
          challenging to standardize results for the user interface.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Solution:</strong> We developed different templates for the
          results page in the User Interface for every public API recognized by
          the Query Generator.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 id="future-work-conclusion">8. Future Work & Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          While GAIT provides a solid foundation for natural language
          interaction with GraphQL APIs, several areas for future improvements
          have been identified. These enhancements aim to make the platform more
          robust, user-friendly, and capable of handling a wider range of use
          cases.
        </p>

        <h3>Enhanced NLP Capabilities</h3>
        <p>
          To improve accuracy, we aim to implement state-of-the-art machine
          learning models, such as transformer-based architectures (e.g., BERT,
          GPT), to enhance intent recognition. Additionally, entity extraction
          will be refined to better identify key elements like dates, names, and
          locations within user queries.
        </p>

        <h3>Integration with More GraphQL APIs</h3>
        <p>
          We plan to expand the range of supported GraphQL APIs, including
          public APIs such as GitHub and Shopify, as well as allowing users to
          configure their own API endpoints dynamically. Furthermore, an API
          discovery feature will be introduced to help users explore and
          integrate APIs seamlessly.
        </p>

        <h3>Performance Optimization</h3>
        <p>
          Optimizing query execution speed will be a key focus, including
          implementing parallelized API requests, refining the NLU module, and
          leveraging caching mechanisms to reduce redundant API calls.
        </p>

        <h3>Improved User Experience</h3>
        <p>
          Enhancing error handling by providing more informative messages and
          troubleshooting guides will improve usability. Additionally,
          personalization features, such as user preferences for language and
          theme settings, will be introduced.
        </p>

        <h3>Security and Privacy Enhancements</h3>
        <p>
          To protect user data, we will implement end-to-end encryption for
          sensitive information, such as user credentials and API keys.
        </p>

        <h3>Integration with Other Technologies</h3>
        <p>
          Future developments will include integrating GAIT with chatbot
          platforms like Slack and Microsoft Teams, as well as extending voice
          command support to smart assistants like Amazon Alexa and Google
          Assistant.
